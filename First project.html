<p><h2>Café Racer</h2>
The updated Royal Enfield Continental GT 650 takes <br>
its inspiration from the 1970s era of British motorcycling,<br>
with its cast alloy wheels and blacked-out aesthetic.<br>
Alongside its classically-styled, ‘50s and ‘60s-inspired predecessors,<br>
it recaptures the spirit of the cafe racer culture of the time <br>
and that of our own Continental GT 250. <br>
With its sculpted tank, eager attitude and <br>
tucked-in riding position, it carries all the hallmarks of a traditional <br>
<mark>café racer</mark> making it perfect for carving up <br>
the back roads or having a ton of fun in the city.</p>
